In the Australian state of Victoria on a hot, dry summer day fire can 
spread at up to 10 km/h in forest and up to 20 km/h in grassland. 
The timeliness of the initial response to a fire is critical to containment 
and reducing the severity and impact of the fire. 

Victoria has a network of almost 90 active fire watch towers. When smoke is sighted, these towers 
use a triangulation method to narrow in on the exact location. 

In this application when you select 2 or more towers, lines are drawn from 
each tower at the given bearing will intersect indicating the location of the smoke. 

This application is intended to replicate and simplify the manual 
triangulation process, while at the same time incorporate modern 
reverse geocoding capabilities that can convert a location into an address.

Smoke Locate is intended to be as simple to use as possible and is designed to be 
usable on small screens, such as phones and tablets, that may be in field operation.
