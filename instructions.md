#### Step 1: 
Locate the towers that have observed a smoke column. You can zoom into the 
area or use the search  <i class="fas fa-search"></i> option in the top left 
of the map to find a specific tower. You can also select the "TFB District" 
option in the map layers and then zoom to any "Total Fire Ban District" by clicking on it.

If an observation is not from a tower, you can click on the 
__Add Observation Post__ switch.  Then zoom into the area of the observation 
and click on the map to create a new temporary location.  

#### Step 2: 
Click on __ALL__ of the towers for which you have a known bearing to the smoke column. 

#### Step 3: 
Enter the bearing of the smoke sighting for each tower and adjust the visibility distance. 
Then click on the __Calculate__ button. 

#### Step 4: 
If a location is successfully calculated, a __Download__ button will appear. 
Once clicked, a HTML report will download, this can either be shared directly 
or saved as a PDF before emailing.
