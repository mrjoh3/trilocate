In Victoria on a hot, dry summer day fire can spread at up to 10 km/h in forest and up to 20 km/h in grassland. 
The timeliness of the initial emergency response to a fire is critical to containment and reducing the severity 
and impact of the fire. 

Victoria has a network of 85 fire watch towers. When smoke is sighted, these towers use a triangulation method 
to narrow in on the exact location. This application is intended to replicate 
and simplify the manual triangulation process, while at the same time incorporate modern reverse geocoding 
capabilities that can convert a location into an address.

When you select 2 or more towers, the lines drawn from each tower at the given bearing will intersect indicating 
the location of the smoke. 

## Modify for Other Locations

While this project is made for the state of Victoria in Australia, it can be modified for any area. If you have 
network of towers or observation points in your area this application can be modified to suite.
